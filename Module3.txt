Write a program that causes the built-in LED connected to pin 13 on the Arduino to blink, alternating between fast blinks and slow blinks. The LED should blink 5 times quickly and then it should blink 5 more times slowly. When blinking quickly, the LED should have a 1 second period, so it should be high for 0.5 seconds and low for 0.5 seconds. When blinking slowly, the LED should have a 4 second period, so it should be high for 2 seconds and low for 2 seconds. The LED should continue to blink in this alternating fashion for as long as the Arduino receives power.
Make sure your program compiles.
Then, save a text version of your program and upload it here. Do not upload the executable file.





const int ledPin = 13;
int ledState = LOW;              ledState used to set the LED
int flash = 5;

unsigned long previousMillis = 0;         will store last time LED was updated

const long interval = 1000;            interval at which to blink (milliseconds)


void setup() {
pinMode (ledPin, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
 
 
 
 for (int i=0; iflash; i++){
 
    unsigned long currentMillis = millis();
    if(currentMillis - previousMillis = interval) {
     save the last time you blinked the LED
    previousMillis = currentMillis;   


    if the LED is off turn it on and vice-versa
    if (ledState == LOW)
      ledState = HIGH;
    else
      ledState = LOW;

     set the LED with the ledState of the variable
    digitalWrite(ledPin, ledState);
  }
}
delay (5000);
